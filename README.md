This app is an incomplete LMS that successfully implements role-based authentication and CRUD Rest functionality, and it renders Markdown with KaTeX through Rehype/Remark plugins in real-time. 

## State of this project

The intent of this project was to create a light LMS for creating practice quizzes for my students, which I hoped to extend to a reusable Next.js LMS template. However, as it has grown, so too has its scope -- I now seek to create a standalone subscription service, and the business logic is growing prohibitively complex. To that end, I am writing the backend in Express and refactoring the frontend.
